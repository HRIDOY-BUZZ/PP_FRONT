            service (the "<strong>Price Comparison shopping Engine</strong>") and any other Merchant products or services we may
            provide you (collectively, the "<strong>Merchant Program</strong>"). Participation in the Merchant Program is
            subject to this PRICEPOND.COM.AU Merchant Program Participation Agreement (the "<strong>Agreement</strong>").</p>
        <p>This Agreement explains our respective obligations under the Merchant Program. By completing and submitting your

        <p><strong>Marketplace Specific Terms</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Listing Advertisements</strong>. We provide an online shopping search engine that assists
                consumers in shopping for products and services offered by Merchants. Consumer searches generally return
                relevant listings, advertising or other content containing links to locations for Merchant&rsquo;s products
                &ndash; e.g., links to your Website (defined below), coupon or deal content, etc. (collectively,
                "<strong>Listings</strong>"). The Marketplace permits you to advertise on the PRICEPOND.COM.AU Network (defined
                below) and bid for click-throughs to such links and/or click-throughs to your Website (defined below) generated
                from the PRICEPOND.COM.AU Network ("<strong>Clicks</strong>"). Listings may include text and graphics, as well
                as information about product characteristics, availability and price, and other content in accordance with our
                policies, which we may update from time-to-time. We make no representations regarding the rank, location and
                prominence of any Listing and have the sole right to determine whether and where a Listing will be displayed in
                response to a given search and within the PRICEPOND.COM.AU Network. We may refuse, edit or remove any Listing
                for violation of the letter or spirit of these terms, or for any other lawful reason. However, we have no
                obligations to monitor, refuse, edit or remove any Listing for violation of these terms or other reasons.</li>

                is generated from your Listing, and any data or information you allow us to directly obtain from a website owned
                or controlled by you (your "<strong>Website</strong>"), throughout or in connection with the PRICEPOND.COM.AU
                Network. The &ldquo;PRICEPOND.COM.AU Network&rdquo; includes websites we provide comparison-shopping content to,
                email newsletters or other email, or other media or services we offer to consumers from time-to-time.</li>

                agree that charges will be based on the total number of Clicks multiplied by the amount you have bid for each
                Click. We may adjust our minimum bids or other bidding requirements from time-to-time on reasonable prior notice
                to you. You agree to pay all applicable charges for your participation in the shopping comparison site in AUD
                dollars in accordance with your agreed to payment plan and billing terms, including any applicable sales, use
