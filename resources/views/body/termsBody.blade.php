                WAIVED.&nbsp;<br /><br />(c) In
                some jurisdictions limitations of liability are not permitted and, therefore, some of the above limits
                may not
                apply in all instances.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>9. DISCLAIMER OF

                and
                policies). We also may, in some instances, need to provide you with operating rules or additional terms
                that
                govern your use of parts of our Site or any Service ("Additional Terms"). Accordingly, you agree that we

                any time provide you with Additional Terms, or update or modify these Terms of Use, as appropriate or
                necessary.
                To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms of Use, the Additional Terms will

                you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English version of
                these Terms
                of Use governs your relationship with us. The English language version takes precedence if there is any
                contradiction between the English and translated versions.&nbsp;<br /><br />(b) No waiver by either of
                us of any
                breach or default under these Terms of Use shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent
                breach
                or default. The section headings used in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not be
                given any
                legal import.&nbsp;<br /><br />(c) Except where specifically stated otherwise (e.g., Section 11(e)), if
                any part
                of these Terms of Use are deemed unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that
                part of
                the Terms of Use shall be stricken and that the remaining terms in the Terms of Use shall not be
                affected and
                shall remain in force and effect.&nbsp;<br /><br />(d) You may not assign these Terms of Use or assign

                rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written
                consent.&nbsp;<br /><br />(e) These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms
                incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all previous written or oral
                agreements, between you and PRICEPOND.COM.AU in connection with the Site and
                Service.&nbsp;<br /><br />&copy;
